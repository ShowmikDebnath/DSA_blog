        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Recursion Algorithm</h2>
       
        <p class="font-1">
            Recursion is the process of calling the function by itself as its subroutine to solve the complex program. Recursion uses the method of dividing the program into sub-tasks and calling it repeatedly instead of the iterative method which takes lots of effort and time to solve the same problem. Therefore, the function which calls itself is called the recursive function, and the process of calling a function by itself is called recursion. The most important thing about the recursion is it should have the base case to terminate the recursion. As the recursive function calls itself continuously, it is always possible that the program goes into the infinite loop.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>How Does Recursion Work?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the recursion approach is to solve the problem effectively in comparison to another problem-solving approach. The recursion process divides the problem into the subtask as a function and continuously calls the same function again to get one step closer to the final solution. 
            <br>
            This process continues until we find the final solution to the problem. Each time the part of the solution is found, it is stored in the form of stack data structure in the memory and at last, popped out to get the final solution. As we approach the final solution, there is a base condition that should be checked to get out of the recursion process. This base condition is checked using the conditional statement and hence avoids the recursion process to get into the infinite loop. If for any reason the base case fails to work, the program will fall into an infinite loop and we will never reach the solution of the program. Below is the working of recursion in C++.
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b>Rules For Recursive Function:-</b></h3>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b> No :-1</b></h3> In recursion, it is essential for a function to call itself, otherwise recursion will not take place.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b> No :-2</b></h3>Only user defined functions can be involved in recursion.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b> No :-3</b></h3> To stop the recursive function it is necessary to base the recursion on test conditions and proper terminating statements such as exit() or return must be written using if() statement.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b> No :-4</b></h3> When a recursive function is executed, the recursive calls are not implemented instantly. All the recursive calls are pushed onto the stack until the terminating condition is not detected, the recursive calls stored in the stack are popped and executed.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b> No :-5</b></h3> During recursion, each recursive call new memory is allocated to all the local variables of the recursive functions with the same name.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Example of Fibonacci Series :-</b>
            <br>
            <img src="img/Recursion2.png" alt="" class="Recursion-img">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b>Fibonacci series : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 … … …</b></h3>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>Each number sum of two previous ones.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>Example of a recursive formula :
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b>fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)</b></h3>
           
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b>Process :-</b></h3>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b>Step 1 :-</b></h3>Firstly, we are going to sum 0 and 1 the result will be f(2) = 1.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b>Step 2 :-</b></h3> After repeating the process second time we will get, f(3) = 1 + 1 = 2
            Simultaneously f(2) = 0+1= 1.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b>Step 3 :-</b></h3>Finally, after summation  f(2) & f(3) we will get f(4) = 2 + 1 = 3.
            After completing the full process the 4-th fibonacci number will be f(4) = 3

            Given N find the nth fibonacci number.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b>Input format:-</b></h3>
            First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, integer N.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><b>Output format:-</b></h3>
            For each test case, output in a single line answer given by modulo 100000007.

            T grather than or equal 1 and smaller than or equal 200000
